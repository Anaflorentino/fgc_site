                <p>Elisa left Brazil with dreams of a brighter future in California. Upon arriving, she faced challenges
                    like language barriers and homesickness. But her determination led her to a job at Flash Guys

                <p>Elisa didn’t just clean palces; she transformed them into home for the families. Inspired by her
                    journey, she began mentoring other immigrant women, encouraging them to pursue their professional
                    goals.</p>
